    <h1>Hello, I'm Fatma Karam, AI engineer and Data Scientist.</h1>
    <!-- <hr> -->
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p class="summary_paragraph">I have always been passionate in the Machine Learning, and Data Science fields. 
        After graduating from Systems and Biomedical department, Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University in 2020 
        with an Excellent grade with honors. I got an internship opportunity from Ministry of Communication to make my master's degree.
        With a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from Queen's University, Canada, that I have just finished, 
        this made me gain a lot of experience in those fields.</p>
